        <h3>Why Code</h3>
        <p>
          I love to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seriously, the sheer amount of stuff to learn when it comes to programming is incomprehensible. The amount of
          different languages out there are enormous, allowing developers to choose how they want to write their applications.
          Beyond that it is literally learning a language there are a multitude of ways to communicate the same thing and, as
          my knowledge grows of a language I'm able to communicate it in a more effective and eloquent way. Each new "A-ha"
          moment is another little adrenaline rush that keeps me hooked
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond that, problem-solving is intrinsic to coding. Not only is it about trying to solve logistical and societal
          problems, writing code itself requires problem solving. How can you write that codeblock so that it's easy to 
          reason about so that maintaining your codebase is manageable? Or, those moments of excitement when you finally figure out
          how to squash a bug you've been running into. That's why I code.

        <h3>Why JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript has a vibrant and inspiring community. The rapid pace of it's growth and the constant innovations
          made with JavaScript make it the most exciting language, to me. Especially with the advent of Electron, where
          JavaScript can now be used outside the browser to make desktop applications. Beyond all of that, I'm a Front-End
          Developer so of course I love JavaScript!
